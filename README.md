# DecisionTree

## BRIEF
This is a program that generates decision tree from data that contains discrete values based on [ID3 algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3_algorithm). 

## TODO
* Measures to counter overfitting to be implemented.
* Representation in text files to be implemented. 
* Algorithms for generating decision trees for continuousÂ values to be implemented.
